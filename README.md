# Building API for Prodcut Catalog

## A top-down approach of creating APIs of our website
I have built the following APIs to isolate data from our presentation. The following APIs are required to enhance the data-set.

### Requirements
- Install node.js 
- Run node products.js
- Hit APIs from your favorite REST console (e.g. Postman)
